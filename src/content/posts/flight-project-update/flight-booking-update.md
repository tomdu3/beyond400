## Alternative title: Fly Or Die - Being Real.

Two weeks ago, I set off on an ambitious journey to create a light booking system using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js). Fueled by a fervor to bring my vision to life, I dove headfirst into planning, structuring the database, designing the user interface, and managing backend user authentication. I even tackled essential functionalities such as flight searches and airport management, along with orchestrating flight offers.

However, as the deadline loomed closer, reality hit me like a freight train. I was emotionally and physically drained, and two weeks turned out to be insufficient time to bring my project to fruition. Burnout and failure felt imminent, but through this experience, I discovered a different perspective on the inevitable challenges of the development journey.

#### The Reality Check

Initially, I was motivated by the idea of swiftly completing a project that combined various facets of web development. I was coding like a madman, fueled by the excitement of possibilities and a drive to create something remarkable. However, this rush led me to overlook several essential aspects of developing a robust application. As I frantically coded solutions, I realized that many components of my implementation were already existing in more efficient forms and integrated with real-time data.

As I delved deeper into my learnings, it became evident that I was not just building a system but also cultivating my skills as a developer. The process revealed to me the myriad of standards, best practices, and architectural patterns that I had yet to fully grasp. The realization that I needed more timeâ€”not just to complete the project but to learn the craftâ€”was both disheartening and enlightening.

#### A Shift in Mindset

After much contemplation, I decided to pivot my approach. Instead of surrendering to the stress of an impending deadline, I embraced the opportunity to redefine my goals. I resolved to take a step back and thoughtfully complete the project over the coming months. It would no longer be my primary focus, but I committed to dedicating time each week to develop the booking system further.

This shift in mindset allowed me to escape the trap of burnout. By adopting a slower pace, I can ensure that each aspect of the project receives the attention it deserves. My aim is not just to finish the system but to create something specialâ€”an application that is well-designed, performant, and reflective of best practices in modern development.

#### Lessons Learned and the Path Ahead

As I embark on this extended timeline for completing the booking system, Iâ€™m eager to share my learnings through my blog. For both budding developers and seasoned pros, the lessons from this journey serve as reminders that progress often comes with its speed bumps. It's okay to take your time to learn and refine your approach rather than rushing to meet deadlines.

In the coming months, I will delve more deeply into the various technologies, patterns, and methodologies that can enhance my work. This project is not just about building software; itâ€™s about evolving as a developer. With each week, Iâ€™ll contribute a little more to the system, experimenting with new tools, gathering feedback, and integrating newfound knowledge.

#### Conclusion
In conclusion, while I encountered challenges and moments of doubt, Iâ€™ve chosen to view them as opportunities for growth rather than setbacks. As I chart this new course for my MERN stack light booking system, I embrace the journey ahead, excited for what I will learn and create along the way. After all, the most fulfilling projects are often the ones that evolve over time, reflecting both the creator's capabilities and the journey itself.
