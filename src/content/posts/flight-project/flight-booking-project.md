# ✈️ Building a Flight Booking & Reservation System in Just 2 Weeks! �

**Flight booking systems** are the backbone of modern travel, and I’m excited to share my journey in building one from scratch—**in just two weeks!** 🚀  

## 🔥 What’s Inside?  

This **Flight Booking & Reservation System** is packed with powerful features:  

- ✈️ **Smart Flight Search** – Filter flights by date, destination, and passenger count.  
- 💰 **Price Comparison** – Compare fares across airlines and booking classes.  
- 🎟️ **Seamless Booking** – Select flights, pick seats, and reserve instantly.  
- 📅 **Booking Management** – Modify, cancel, or check past reservations.  
- 🔒 **Secure Payments** – Multiple payment options with instant confirmations.  
- 📲 **Real-Time Alerts** – Flight updates, delays, and reminders via email/SMS.  
- 📊 **Data-Driven Insights** – Analytics on bookings, trends, and cancellations.  

## ⚡ Tech Stack  

To make this happen, I’m using:  
- **MERN Stack** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)  
- **TailwindCSS** for sleek, responsive styling  
- **Payment Gateways** (Stripe/PayPal) for secure transactions  
- **Airline APIs** for live flight data  
- **Netlify/Render** for deployment  

## 🚀 The Challenge  

With only **14 days** to build, test, and deploy, I’m both **anxious and hyped!** But with a solid plan and the right tools, I’m confident this will be an amazing project.  

Stay tuned for updates—I’ll share my jester-like progress updates as I go along! 😉
