## Introduction

I am a software developer and a Python enthusiast. I love to learn new things and explore the world of programming. This the beginning of my journey in the software development world.

## The Beginning

After a long period of living a totally different life, I decided to start my journey in the software development world. I first started with learning the basics of Python and programming a couple of years ago. I was fascinated by the possibilities of programming and the endless possibilities that it could bring to my life.

Then the covid pandemic hit and I understood I didn't love my life and I wanted to do some drastic changes in every aspect of my living. I started a bootcamp at Code Institute, Dublin and learned a lot of new things. I learned how to use Git, GitHub, and VS Code. I enjoyed learning about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and making websites. I continued perfecting my Python. I also learned about relational databases and how to use SQL, PostgreSQL, MySQL. Then I learned Flask and Django and fell in love with web development (especially backend).

After that, I started learning about machine learning and data science. I learned about TensorFlow, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib and Keras.

After my bootcamp, I went through other few trainings and courses in Data Science and Web Development. I learned about React, Tailwind CSS, ExpressJS, and MongoDB.

In the meantime I quit my job, I came to the UK, then Germany, then UK again and I started tutoring and mentoring people in the Python community. I also started contributing to open source projects. 

## The Journey

All in all, I discovered that I loved the creative nature of coding and wanted to share my passion with the world. I really think coding can transforme lives and change the world. I want to share my journey with you and hopefully inspire you to do the same. Last year I decided to code every day. No day without a line *(of code)*, or in Latin **Nulla die sine linea**. I coded for 400 days straight. And I will continue to code every day and bring here some new things I am working on or discovering.

I want to thank [üç•Fuwari](https://github.com/saicaca/fuwari) for the original Astro blog template I am using here.

Let's code!

```r
print("Hello World!", quote = TRUE)
```

```output
[1] "Hello World!"
```
